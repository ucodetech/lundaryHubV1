/// Bridges PHP's authoritative router stack with SwiftUI's
/// `NavigationStack` `path` binding, so:
///
/// - **PHP-initiated navigation** (`navigate()` / `back()` / `replace()`)
///   pushes / pops / swaps entries on `path`; SwiftUI animates.
/// - **User-initiated pop** (edge-swipe-back, system back button) shrinks
///   `path`; the coordinator detects the shrink and fires
///   `sendSystemBackEvent` so the PHP runloop pops to match.
///
/// **Path semantics.** `path` contains ONLY the pushed levels above the
/// root. The bottommost (root) URI is tracked separately as `rootUri` —
/// SwiftUI's NavigationStack treats every entry in its `path` binding as
/// a pushed destination on top of the implicit root closure, so storing
/// the root in `path` would duplicate it (root + identical pushed copy =
/// two back chevrons, broken pop behavior).
///
/// Per-URI cache (`rootNodeCache`) holds the most recent rendered tree
/// for each level (root and pushed). The renderer's destination resolver
/// reads from this so during push / pop animations, both the from- and
/// to-screens render their actual content (not a blank placeholder).
