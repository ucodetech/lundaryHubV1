/**
 * Builder for a continuous location stream (Geolocation::watchPosition()).
 *
 * Unlike the one-shot Pending* builders, the result is not a single event but
 * a stream of LocationUpdated events — so the handler is a PERSISTENT listener
 * on the live component (the same primitive as fluent websocket listeners),
 * not a one-shot NativeCallbacks entry:
 *
 *     $this->watchId = Geolocation::watchPosition(fineAccuracy: true)
 *         ->interval(2000)      // ms between updates (Android pacing)
 *         ->minDistance(5)      // meters moved before a new fix (both platforms)
 *         ->locationUpdated(function ($event) {
 *             $this->lat = $event->latitude;   // $this is the component
 *             $this->lng = $event->longitude;
 *         })
 *         ->getId();
 *
 * The watch stops automatically when the component unmounts; stop it earlier
 * with Geolocation::clearWatch($this->watchId). Multiple concurrent watches
 * are supported — each handler only receives its own watch's updates.
 *
 * Streaming is foreground-only by default: the OS suspends location delivery
 * when the app is backgrounded. Chain ->background() to run the watch as a
 * native background stream instead — it survives component unmount, app
 * backgrounding, process death and reboot, buffering every fix natively
 * until Geolocation::drainWatch($id, $cursor) collects it. Live updates
 * still reach ->locationUpdated() handlers while the app is foregrounded.
 * Stop with Geolocation::stopBackgroundWatch($id).
